I work at Oxford University's Big Data Institute at the interface of population genetics, evolution and infectious disease. Much of my previous research has involved understanding the processes that have contributed to the genetic ancestry of different human populations.

In addition to the work of others, most notably that involving ancient genomes, this work has shown that the genomes of modern human populations are best viewed as mosaics of ancestry which have come together as the result of specific historical events. We all have a mixture of ancestries.

Advances in our ability to sequence large numbers of samples quickly and cheaply are now spreading to non-human organisms. My current work with MalariaGEN involves helping to build large open access datasets of Plasmodium and Anopheles genomes from around the world. The challenge now is to extract meaningful information from these genomes that can be used to inform decision making as we continue towards malaria elimination.

I am also increasingly active in thinking about new and different ways of communicating this science to the public. I’ve developed a malaria genetics based card game (Cards against malaria) that describes how genetics susceptibility to disease works. I’m also collaborating with the Oxford based children’s comic The Phoenix to develop a strip about DNA and genetics, and am working with playwright Beth Flintoff to produce a play about the future use of genetics and big data in healthcare.
